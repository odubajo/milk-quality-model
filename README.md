# milk quality model 

For this project we will be exploring milk quality data, the data consists of 7 features, we will be trying to predict if the milk quality is low, medium or high based on these features

About dataset
This dataset is manually collected from observations. It helps us to build machine learning models to predict the quality of milk.
This dataset consists of 7 independent variables ie pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and Color.
Generally, the Grade or Quality of the milk depends on these parameters. These parameters play a vital role in the predictive analysis of the milk.

Usage
The target variable is nothing but the Grade of the milk. It can be

Target

Low (Bad)

Medium (Moderate)

High (Good)
